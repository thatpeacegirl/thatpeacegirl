## Hi, I’m Peace!
I’m an aspiring full-stack developer currently learning front-end web development technologies. I also have special interests in 3D modelling, [writing](https://thatpeacegirl.hashnode.dev/), and learning about other programming languages  — Python in particular. When I'm not coding, you can find me reading, or seeking out new music.

- 🌱 Currently learning Bootstrap, JavaScript and Python.
- 💞️ Currently looking to also collaborate on open source projects.
- 📫 Want to get in touch? You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/__thatpeacegirl) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peace-adamson/).
