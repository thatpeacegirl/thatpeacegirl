## Hi, I’m Peace!
I’m an aspiring data scientist currently learning about extracting insights from data. I also have special interests in meditation, [writing](https://thatpeacegirl.hashnode.dev/), and finding out random but meaningful facts! When I'm not coding, you can find me reading, or listening to podcasts.

- 🌱 Currently learning about Machine Learning, Spreadsheet tools, and Visualization software.
- 💞️ Currently looking to also collaborate on open source projects.
- 📫 Want to get in touch? You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/__thatpeacegirl) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peace-adamson/).
